	<h3>Why Fitness Matters</h3>
	<p>The benefits of regular exercise and good physical fitness for everyone have become well known in the past 50 years. So, how do these benefits apply to you?</p>

	<p>
		People with CF can work with their care team to find ways to exercise safely. Regular exercise is tough and we all find reasons to avoid it. But it makes sense, for some pretty basic and powerful reasons:

		<ul>
			<li>Better overall health: Our bodies were made to be active. When we become inactive, we put ourselves at increased risk for heart and bone disease, diabetes and cancer.</li>
			<li>More energy: When you improve your heart, lung and muscle function, you have more energy for daily tasks, as well as daily CF treatments.</li>
			<li>Better lung function: Regular exercise can improve your ability to get mucus out of your airways.</li>
			<li>More time with others: Taking part in physical activities with other people is a good way to motivate yourself and a great way to maintain social relationships.</li>
		</ul>
		
		Even when you are in the hospital you should try to move about as much as possible. This will help you maintain your fitness level and you will do better when you are discharged. When you are in the hospital, ask your CF team to have an order written so someone can help you exercise while you're there.
		The bottom line is that our bodies were made to move. Being inactive is unnatural for your body and can give rise to disease and disability.
